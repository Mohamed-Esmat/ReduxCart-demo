## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Redux Cart Project**. This project is designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of Redux while building a React application that manages state and handles asynchronous operations and side effects appropriately.

### Key Concepts Covered

1. **Redux Principles**: Understanding the core principles of Redux, including reducers, actions, and the store.

2. **Asynchronous Code**: Handling asynchronous operations such as HTTP requests within a Redux application.

3. **Redux Toolkit**: Leveraging Redux Toolkit for efficient state management and simplified Redux setup.

4. **Action Creators**: Creating custom action creators to manage side effects without impacting reducer functions.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install project dependencies.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server.

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows standard React-Redux conventions. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - **`components/`**: React components used in the application.
  - **`store/`**: Redux store configuration.
  - **`App.js`**: The main application component.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point for the React application.

## Project Walkthrough

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Initial Setup**: The starting project includes React components that display dummy data. These components are non-interactive.

2. **Adding Redux**: Redux is introduced to the project to manage application state.

3. **Implementing Logic**: The project implements logic to make the application interactive. Key features include:
   - Toggling the cart display.
   - Adding products to the cart.
   - Modifying product quantities in the cart.
